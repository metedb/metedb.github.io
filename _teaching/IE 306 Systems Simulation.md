For one semester, I worked as a teaching assistant for the Systems Simulation course offered to Computer Science students at Boğaziçi University, under the instruction of Associate Professor Aybek Korugan. The curriculum focused on modelling real-world systems and conducting simulations to analyze their behavior and evaluate alternative operational strategies. It covered topics such as stochastic processes, queuing theory, discrete event simulations, effective random variate generation, and statistical analysis of simulation outcomes. My responsibilities included preparing assignments, where I contributed by researching these topics to create applied, real-world problems for students. During assignment preparations, I handled large-scale datasets, performing data manipulation and cleaning tasks. Additionally, I graded assignments and conducted review sessions for students when needed. You can view the course page [here](https://ie.bogazici.edu.tr/courses/ie-306-systems-simulation).
