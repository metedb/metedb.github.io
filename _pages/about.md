My name is Mete, and I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Computational Applied Mathematics programme at the University of Edinburgh, with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Bogazici University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boğaziçi_University), Istanbul. I am passionate about addressing complex, real-world challenges through mathematical and computational modelling, data analytics, and advanced statistical methods to generate insights for decision-makers. My focus is on transforming complex data into clear and actionable solutions that can drive impactful decisions. With a strong foundation in efficiency and optimisation from my background in Operations Research, I approach problem-solving with a focus on practical constraints.

This website is continuously updated to showcase some of my latest projects.

In my personal life, I am an active musician and have performed as a vocalist in over 30 stage shows with various bands. I also play the piano and guitar in my free time, and I enjoy bouldering. In addition, I hold a minor degree in economics, with a particular intellectual interest in game theory and macroeconomics.
