My name is Mete, and I'm a recent graduate of the Master's in Computational Applied Mathematics programme at the University of Edinburgh, with a bachelors degree in Industrial Engineering from [Bogazici University, Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boğaziçi_University). My research interests include developing computational models and simulations of real-world problems, as well as applying data analytics and statistical methods to generate insights that inform decision-makers. My background in industrial engineering gives me a strong focus on efficiency and optimization, which I apply in my research to devise optimized solutions under constraints. I am particularly interested in advancing my career in the biomedical sciences domain, where I aim to apply my quantitative skills.

Outside of academics, I am an active musician and have performed as a vocalist in over 30 stage performances with various bands. I also play the piano and guitar in my free time, and I enjoy bouldering.
