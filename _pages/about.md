My name is Mete, and I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Computational Applied Mathematics programme at the University of Edinburgh, with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Boğaziçi University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boğaziçi_University), Istanbul. My research interests focus on developing computational models and simulations of real-world problems, as well as applying data analytics and statistical methods to generate insights for decision-makers. My background in industrial engineering has given me a strong focus on efficiency and optimization, which fuels my interest in devising optimized solutions to such problems under real-life constraints. I am particularly keen on advancing my career in the biomedical sciences, where I aim to apply my quantitative skills to data-driven approaches within the field.

Outside of academics, I am an active musician and have performed as a vocalist in over 30 stage shows with various bands. I also play the piano and guitar in my free time, and I enjoy bouldering.
