Cancer remains a complex and devastating disease, and the exact causes underlying many cancers are still not fully understood. For my MSc thesis project, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Nicholson](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-nicholson) and [Dr. Craig Anderson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/craig-anderson) from the [Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer) at the University of Edinburgh. Over the course of three months, we extended an existing probabilistic model of mutation accumulation by incorporating the differential dynamics observed in genes. The aim was to rigorously assess the performance of a statistical estimator designed to indicate the expected amount of DNA damage driving cancer. 

By designing simulations and generating in-silico data of cancerous tissues, we focused on evaluating the estimator's accuracy across various cancer-like scenarios characterized by malfunctions in different DNA damage response pathways. Our findings demonstrated that, in most cases, the estimator is robust, particularly for cancers involving severe impairments in these pathways. However, we also identified specific biological scenarios where the estimations could be misleading. Ultimately, we aimed bridge two primarily biological studies through quantitative formalism in this study, generating insights that may prove significant in understanding the underlying causes of many cancers of unknown origin.
