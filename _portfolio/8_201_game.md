I conceptualised and implemented a game design rooted in **network theory**, specifically using a "preferential attachment" social network model. In these networks, individuals gain influence following a **power law distribution**, meaning that highly connected individuals tend to accumulate even more connections, mirroring the structure of real-world social systems.

In the game, players take on the role of a spy infiltrating an enemy militant network, which is characterized by continuous recruitment and a hierarchical structure. The goal is to indoctrinate enemy militants into your ideology, while enemy spies work to do the same with their own beliefs. The game effectively demonstrates how shifts in the opinions of the most influential leaders propagate down the hierarchy to lower-ranked militants. Moreover, it shows how, after a certain point, it becomes increasingly difficult to influence the network, emphasizing the importance of **early intervention** and strategically targeting key individuals (nodes) within the network.

The game was designed following **object-oriented design** principles, ensuring well-defined relationships between objects and actions in each scenario:

I achieved the highest grade in the class for this project,
independently managing tasks typically handled by groups of 3-4
students. You can view the project and code [here](https://github.com/metedb/Preferential-Attachment-Game.git).
