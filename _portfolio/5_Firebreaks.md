Agent-based models are used when the goal is to simulate complex systems from the bottom up, focusing on the interactions between individual components (or agents) to observe emergent behavior at the system level. Instead of modeling the entire system as a whole, these models allow us to explore how local actions and decisions can lead to global outcomes. 

As part of my Industrial Mathematics course, we worked on a **cellular automata agent-based model** of fire spread to critically evaluate possible preventative measures. These included the impact of fire-resistant building materials, the design of firebreaks within the city, and the action plans of firefighters. The goal was to inform relevant agencies about how best to implement measures to reduce the spread and impact of fires, while also considering budget constraints, as such measures are often costly.

Our model suggested that the optimal proportion of fire-resistant material is 60%, distributed throughout the city. Additionally, we found that a combination of straight and diagonal firebreaks across the city provided the best configuration to minimize fire spread. We also identified that, while all firefighter strategies reduced the spread of fire, units working individually and attending their nearest fire were able to extinguish fires fastest on average. 

In our analysis, we performed robustness tests and incorporated empirical data to inform parameter values whenever available. As a result of our findings, we recommended that policymakers implement all three measures—fire-resistant materials, strategic firebreaks, and optimized firefighter strategies—in conjunction. We placed particular emphasis on the use of fire-resistant materials, as this measure had the largest impact on reducing fire spread.
