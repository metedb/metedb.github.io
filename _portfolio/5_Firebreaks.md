Agent-based models are used when the goal is to simulate complex systems from the bottom up, focusing on the interactions between individual components (or agents) to observe emergent behavior at the system level. Instead of modeling the entire system as a whole, these models allow us to explore how local actions and decisions can lead to global outcomes. Some examples include simulating traffic flow, where individual vehicles (agents) follow simple rules to model congestion patterns; modeling the spread of infectious diseases, where individual agents represent people and their interactions determine the spread of the virus; and studying financial markets, where traders (agents) make decisions based on market conditions, leading to broader economic trends. By focusing on the behavior of individual components, agent-based models can reveal how small-scale interactions give rise to complex system-wide phenomena.

As part of my Industrial Mathematics course, we worked on a **cellular automata agent-based model** of fire spread to critically evaluate possible preventative measures. These included the impact of fire-resistant building materials, the design of firebreaks within the city, and the action plans of firefighters. The goal was to inform relevant agencies about how best to implement measures to reduce the spread and impact of fires, while also considering budget constraints, as such measures are often costly.

Our analysis suggested optimal proportions of fire-resistant building materials, as well as specific combinations of firebreak designs to minimize fire spread as well as minimising cost. We also identified that firefighter units working in sub-groups and attending their nearest fire were able to extinguish fires fastest on average, which was contradictory to intuition of collective action of one big group. 

To support our findings, we conducted robustness tests and used empirical data to inform our parameter values where available. Based on our analysis, we recommended that policymakers implement all three measures—fire-resistant materials, strategic firebreaks, and optimized firefighter deployment—together. We placed particular emphasis on the use of fire-resistant materials, which had the greatest impact on reducing fire spread. As a result of our efforts, our group received the highest mark for the project. <br/><img src='/images/fire_breaks_overview.png'>
