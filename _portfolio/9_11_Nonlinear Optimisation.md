title: "Efficient Search Methods for Optimisation"
excerpt: "Search methods are crucial in optimization, especially in real-world problems where finding the best solution involves complex or noisy functions that are hard to solve analytically. In scenarios such as engineering design, financial modeling, and scientific simulations, where exact gradients are unavailable or too costly to compute, search methods offer practical solutions.This code combines two optimization methods: the Golden Section Search and the Hooke-Jeeves method. The Golden Section Search finds the minimum value of a function in one dimension by narrowing down the interval using a special ratio. In the Hooke-Jeeves method, which is used to solve multi-variable problems, the Golden Section Search is applied in each direction to determine the best step size for adjusting the variables. Hooke-Jeeves explores different directions, checks how the function responds to these changes, and then uses the Golden Section Search to optimize the movement in those directions. This process is repeated to gradually move toward the best solution. The combination of these methods is helpful when you can't rely on gradients or derivatives, such as in complex or noisy functions, making it a robust alternative to more specialized optimization techniques.
