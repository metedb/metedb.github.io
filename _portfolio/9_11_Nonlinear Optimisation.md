title: "Nonlinear Optimisation Algorithms"
excerpt: "This code combines two optimization methods: the Golden Section Search and the Hooke-Jeeves method. The Golden Section Search finds the minimum value of a function in one dimension by narrowing down the interval using a special ratio. In the Hooke-Jeeves method, which is used to solve multi-variable problems, the Golden Section Search is applied in each direction to determine the best step size for adjusting the variables. Hooke-Jeeves explores different directions, checks how the function responds to these changes, and then uses the Golden Section Search to optimize the movement in those directions. This process is repeated to gradually move toward the best solution. The combination of these methods is helpful when you can't rely on gradients or derivatives, such as in complex or noisy functions, making it a robust alternative to more specialized optimization techniques.
