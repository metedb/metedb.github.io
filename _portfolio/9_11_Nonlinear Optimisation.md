title: "Nonlinear Optimisation Algorithms"
excerpt: "A key feature of this algorithm is its derivative-free nature, rendering it an ideal candidate for tackling problems where gradients are either cumbersome to compute or outright impossible to define. This characteristic broadens the algorithm's applicability across various domains, making it a versatile tool in the optimization arsenal. Secant explanation here....
