title: "Dijkstra Algorithm for Shortest Paths"
excerpt: "Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm used to find the **shortest path** between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The algorithm works by starting from a source node and exploring all possible paths to other nodes, updating the shortest known distance to each node as it proceeds. It maintains a priority queue (often implemented with a min-heap) to always expand the least-cost (shortest distance) path next. It ensures that once the shortest path to a node is found, it will not be improved further. Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used for finding the shortest path in road maps, network routing, and various optimization problems.
