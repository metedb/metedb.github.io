title: "Simulating Hamiltonian Dynamics"
excerpt: "As part of my research skills course, we modeled molecular dynamics governed by **Newton's laws of motion**, using different discretization techniques such as **Euler** and **leapfrog** methods to solve the differential equations governing the system. These numerical methods are particularly useful when exact analytical solutions are difficult to obtain. We focused on analyzing the **Hamiltonian energy** of the system and studied how the behavior of particles—whether periodic or chaotic—depends on model parameters. In addition, we conducted an analysis of the model's performance across various conditions.<br/><br/>

The phase plane plot illustrates the trajectories of both particles over time. The red and blue lines represent their movements, influenced by both their connection to the origin and their interaction with each other. The intertwined paths in the plot reveal the complex, coupled dynamics of the system, where the forces between the particles and the springs create entangled motions. This approach is not limited to modeling particle systems; it has broader applications in real-world scenarios. For example, it can be used to model predator-prey dynamics in ecology, predict the spread of diseases with **SIR models** in epidemiology, or approximate financial models like option pricing to help manage risk in financial markets.
