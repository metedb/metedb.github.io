title: "Simulating Hamiltonian Dynamics"
excerpt: "In this project, we modeled two particles connected to the origin by springs, which also interact with each other through a spring potential. To simulate their motion, we used **Euler discretization**, a simple but effective numerical method for solving differential equations, especially when real analytic solutions are hard to find. The phase plane plot shows the trajectories of both particles over time. The red and blue lines represent their movements, influenced by both the connection to the origin and the interaction between the particles. The entangled paths highlight the complex, coupled dynamics of the system. Beyond particle systems, such approaches can also be used in other real-world applications, such as modeling predator-prey dynamics in ecology, predicting the spread of diseases using SIR models in epidemiology, and approximating financial models like option pricing to manage risk. You can explore the full code and analysis [here on my project page].<br/><img src='/images/HAM DYN.png'>"
