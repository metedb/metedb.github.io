Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis,
leading to uneven chromosome distribution among cells and increasing the heterogeneity of the tumor
population; this phenomenon is known as Chromosomal Instability (CIN). Supervised by Dr. Tibor Antal, I worked in a group project and studied the variations of copy number alterations using stochastic modelling approaches and simulations. On top of an existing stochastic model of such variations, our group hypothesised a novel approach by incorporating a Multi-type branching process into CIN studies, a framework frequently used for studying expanding cell populations. We achieved significant insights by quantifying tumour extinction probabilities and karyotype variations in dependence to real life parameters such as the genic characteristic of the chromosome, or the instability rate. Furthermore, we showed the interplay between tumour heterogeneity and preservation of oncogenic genes.
