Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis,
leading to uneven chromosome distribution among cells and increasing the heterogeneity of the tumor
population; this phenomenon is known as Chromosomal Instability (CIN). This paper introduces two
stochastic approaches to cancer evolution influenced by CIN. The first approach, building upon [1],
utilizes a Markovian model to trace and analyze the long-term distribution of karyotypes (chromoso-
mal copy numbers) across hundreds of generations without the need for lengthy computer simulations.
Further analysis within this framework evaluates the impact of CIN dynamics on dominant subpop-
ulations—a large set of cells sharing the same karyotype—and their interplay with heterogeneity,
indicating that high missegregation rates not only increase heterogeneity but also lead to the loss
of favorable karyotypes, and vice versa. We further introduce a numerical framework that focuses
on tracking individual cell lineages, rather than the whole population, to analyze the emergence
times of specific karyotypes, yielding accurate predictions that align with arrival times in stochastic
processes. We then propose a second stochastic approach, a multi-type branching process, and es-
tablish connections between the former approach. This new approach is then utilized to explore the
implications of CIN dynamics on population extinction, suggesting that higher missegregation rates
enhance the likelihood of driving diploid-founded populations toward extinction, particularly those
due to chromosomes known to suppress tumor growth.
