Cancer cells often missegregate chromosomes during mitosis, leading to uneven distribution and increased variability within the tumor, a phenomenon known as Chromosomal Instability (CIN). Under the supervision of Dr. Tibor Antal, I participated in a group project that used stochastic modeling and simulations to study these variations. We extended an existing model by incorporating a Multi-type Branching Process, a framework used to study expanding cell populations. This allowed us to quantify tumour extinction probabilities and variations in chromosome copies, using real-world factors like chromosome characteristics and instability rates. Additionally, we explored how tumor diversity is related to the preservation of cancer-driving genes, shedding light on the evolutionary nature of cancer.
