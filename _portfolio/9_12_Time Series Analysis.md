title: "Time Series Analysis & Forecasting"
excerpt: "As part of coursework, I worked on several projects that focused on applying forecasting methodologies to real-world data. I gained valuable experience in decomposing time series data into trend and seasonal components, identifying patterns using autocorrelation, and incorporating external variables to better explain the behavior of response variables. For our final project, my group implemented a real-life estimator powered by actual electricity consumption data and compared the performance of static and dynamic ARIMA forecasters. Our analysis concluded that the dynamic model consistently outperformed the static model, highlighting the importance of up-to-date data collection in improving forecast accuracy. <br/><br/>These projects not only enhanced my understanding of time series analysis but also equipped me with practical skills in selecting and applying the right forecasting methods for industrial applications. Additionally, they underscored the role of accurate forecasting in informing organisational decision-making, making data-driven strategies more effective. [Here](https://metedb.github.io/time-series-analysis/) are the reports and detailed analyses.
