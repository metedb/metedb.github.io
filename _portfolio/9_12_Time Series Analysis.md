During the course, I worked on several projects that focused on applying forecasting methodologies to real-world data. I gained valuable experience in decomposing time series data into trend and seasonal components, identifying patterns using autocorrelation, and incorporating external variables to better explain the behavior of response variables. I also compared various forecasting techniques, analyzing their performance to determine the best fit for different organizational decision-making scenarios. These projects not only enhanced my understanding of time series analysis but also provided practical skills in selecting and applying the right forecasting methods for industrial applications.
