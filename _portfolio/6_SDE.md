title: "Simulating Stochastic Differential Equations"
excerpt: "Stochastic differential equations are a class of equations used to model systems that are influenced by random processes. They are important and used heavily in fields with inherent uncertainty, such as finance, physics, biology, and engineering. SDE's can help model phenomena like stock prices, population growth, or thermal fluctuations. This topic captured my interest during my studies, and I successfully demonstrated my proficiency by achieving a top grade of 91 in the course. I have also worked on numerous algorithms to simulate stochastic differential equations with different discretisation methods. You can explore the full code and analysis [here on my project page](https://github.com/metedb/SDE-Simulation).<br/><img src='/images/sde image.png'>"
