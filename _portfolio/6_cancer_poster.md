title: "Academic Poster on Site Frequency Spectra in Tumours"
excerpt: "In a recent paper, the authors explored the site frequency spectrum (SFS) in cancer genomics, focusing on exponentially growing cell populations. Traditionally, the SFS has been well-studied in constant-sized populations with neutral mutations, but this research extends the analysis to tumor growth using stochastic branching processes.

The authors derived exact expressions for the expected SFS in two scenarios: for cells with an infinite line of descent and for the entire population. They looked at both a fixed-time spectrum and a fixed-size spectrum, offering insights into how mutation rates, cell birth, and cell death rates affect the shape of the spectrum. Specifically, they showed a transition between a 1/jÂ² and 1/j power-law spectrum, depending on the viability of the cells, and discussed how these patterns can help estimate mutation rates and the ratio of cell death to birth rates.

I created a poster summarizing this work, focusing on how these findings can contribute to understanding tumor dynamics and potentially inform research on other exponentially growing populations.
