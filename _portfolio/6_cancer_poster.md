title: "Academic Poster on Site Frequency Spectra in Tumours"
excerpt: "In a recent study, researchers examined how mutations spread within growing tumors. They focused on a genetic concept called the **site frequency spectrum (SFS)**, which helps scientists understand how common or rare certain mutations are within a population. While this concept has been widely studied in populations that stay the same size, this research looked at tumors, which are constantly growing and changing.

The researchers used mathematical models to predict what the mutation patterns (or SFS) would look like in a growing tumor. They considered two key factors: the **mutation rates** and the balance between **cell growth and cell death**. By studying the SFS, they could identify how these factors shape the genetic landscape of a tumor. Their findings showed that the patterns of mutations could change significantly based on how healthy or viable the tumor cells are.

I created a poster summarizing this research, highlighting how these findings help us better understand the way tumors evolve. The insights gained could also apply to other fast-growing populations, providing useful tools for estimating mutation rates and the balance between cell death and growth in various biological contexts.
